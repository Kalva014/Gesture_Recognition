# Gesture_Recognition
## Description:
In this project, I used IMU sensor readings from gyroscopes and accelerometers to train a set of
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and recognize different arm motion gestures. I was then able to
classify unknown arm motions in real-time using your algorithm.

## Steps for running the file
1. Confirm that the Data folder has the folders for training("ECE5242Proj2_train_additional-selected") and testing("ECE5242Proj2-test-selected")
2. Run all of the cells in the HMM File
